Types of Smart Contracts:


1. Stateless Smart Contracts:

Definition: These contracts do not hold any state or data. They operate based on the information contained in the transaction itself.
Use Cases: Stateless contracts are often used for simple conditions or rules in a transaction, such as validating conditions for asset transfers.



2. Stateful Smart Contracts:

Definition: These contracts can hold state data and can maintain variables across different transactions.
Use Cases: Stateful contracts are suitable for applications requiring persistent storage, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) applications or voting systems.

3. Atomic Transfers:

Definition: A group of transactions that either all succeed or none at all. This ensures that the blockchain remains in a consistent state.
Use Cases: Atomic transfers are useful in multi-party agreements, token swaps, or auctions where conditions must be met before proceeding.




### Algorand Smart Contracts (ASC1) :- ASC1: Algorand Smart Contracts (ASC1) are designed to execute automatically when predefined conditions are met.
