                    # Asset Transfer Transaction # 

'''
Steps :- 

1. Create or opt-in to the ASA (if needed): Before transferring an asset, both the sender and the receiver must have opted into the asset.
    
    Note :- Opting in simply means that they have added the ASA to their accounts.
            Opting in is required for the receiver to hold the asset. 



2. Asset Transfer: Once both parties have opted in, the sender can transfer the asset to the receiver.

3. Confirm the Transaction: Wait for the transaction to be confirmed by the network.
